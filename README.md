WARNING
===============================================================================
This is just my personal .vim directory and the files I use.

You can likely copy it wholesale and it will (kinda) work, but it isn't 
recommended.

Pick and choose what you need, and if you just want a sensible baseline, use 
https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible it is designed to be exactly that!

If you ignore my warnings and try to copy it wholesale, realize you will have
to update the submodules
- git submodule init
- git submodule foreach git checkout master
- git submodule foreach git pull
